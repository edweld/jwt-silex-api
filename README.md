# Silex-JWT-Rest-Php
Sample Project: 

PHP 5.5+ project that utilizes the Silex Framework.  This is a bare bones REST Api that uses JSON Web Tokens for Authentication.

## Getting Started
There are only three basic requirements at the moment to utilize this Demo project.  The first is git ([https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)),
the second is composer ([https://getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org)), and the third is PHPUnit ([https://phpunit.de](https://phpunit.de)).
With these three tools the project is relatively easy to get going and exercise.  The commands listed below have been
tested on Windows, Linux, and OS X terminals.


###  Update all of the dependencies

```
  $ composer update
```

###  Run the tests

```
  $ phpunit
```

###TODO

 - refactor phpseclib package bundle to more abstract use package (and fix bugs) *just RSA and Math for now*
 - alter JWT package to implement phpseclib
